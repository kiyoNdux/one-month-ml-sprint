    "1. **Elimination:** Transform $A$ to a triangular matrix $U$ using a sequence of matrix steps $E_{ij}$.  \n",
    "2. **Back Substitution:** Solve the triangular system from bottom to top.  \n",
    "3. **LU Factorization:** In matrix language, $A$ is factored as $LU = (\\text{lower triangular})(\\text{upper triangular})$.  \n",
    "4. **Invertibility:** Elimination succeeds if $A$ is invertible (may require row exchanges).\n",

    "1. The basic operations on vectors are **scalar multiplication** $cv$ and **vector addition** $v + w$.  \n",
    "2. Together, these operations give **linear combinations** $cv + dw$.  \n",
    "3. **Matrix-vector multiplication $Ax$** can be computed by dot products (row by row), but must also be understood as a **combination of the columns of $A$**.  \n",
    "4. **Column picture:** $Ax = b$ asks for a combination of columns to produce $b$.  \n",
    "5. **Row picture:** Each equation in $Ax = b$ gives a line ($n = 2$), plane ($n = 3$), or \"hyperplane\" ($n > 3$). They intersect at the solution or solutions, if any.\n"
