    "1. With $n$ pivots, elimination solves all equations $Ax_i = e_i$. The columns $x_i$ form $A^{-1}$. Then $AA^{-1}=I$.  \n",
    "2. Elimination is a sequence of multiplications by $I$, $P$ (row exchanges), $D^{-1}$ (pivot division), and $E$ (elimination).  \n",

    "- **Why pivots are necessary (Reverse Reasoning):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Without $n$ pivots, elimination produces a zero row.  \n",
    "2. If $AC = I$ were possible, multiplying by elimination matrices $M$ would produce $MAC = M$, but the zero row prevents this.  \n",
