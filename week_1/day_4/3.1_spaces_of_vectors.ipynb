    "The **column space** of $A$ is the set of all linear combinations of its columns.  \n",
    "These combinations are all vectors of the form $Ax$.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. $\\mathbb{R}^n$ contains all column vectors with $n$ real components.  \n",
    "2. $M$ (matrices), $F$ (functions), and $Z$ (zero-only) are valid vector spaces.  \n",
    "3. Any subspace containing $v$ and $w$ must contain all combinations $cv + dw$.  \n",
    "4. The column space $C(A)$ is the span of the columns of $A$.  \n",
    "5. $Ax = b$ has a solution exactly when $b$ lies in the column space:  \n",
