# One-Month ML Sprint

This repository documents my **intensive, full-time one-month sprint**, where I focused on building hands-on skills in **Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics, Backend Engineering, and Machine Learning**. My goal was to create **hackathon-ready projects and end-to-end pipelines**, while keeping a clear record of everything I learned.

## Sprint Timeline

| Week  | Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Linear Algebra | micro-projects, MatrixOps class, visual notebook |
| 2 | Probability & Statistics | Simulated distributions project, DS workflow notebook |
| 3 | Backend Engineering | Async API endpoints, background jobs, Redis pipelines, WebSocket service |
| 4 | Full ML Project | End-to-end ML pipeline: data ingestion → preprocessing → models → API → minimal frontend |

## Goals & Reflections

- I wanted to learn the **fundamentals** of the linear algebra, stats, backend, that are used in ML.  
- I kept a **structured record** of my progress, reflections, and project outputs.

## How I Use This Repo

- I follow the weeks sequentially to **retrace my learning journey**.  
- I use the notebooks and projects as **templates or references** for future work.  
- The documentation lets me **review concepts and refresh skills** whenever needed.

This repository is my **living record** of a concentrated, one-month sprint — capturing the process, the challenges, and the results of building end-to-end ML and backend expertise.
