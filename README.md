# One-Month ML + Backend Sprint

This repository documents my **intensive, full-time one-month sprint** from **November 27 to December 23, 2025**, where I focused on building hands-on skills in **Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics, Backend Engineering, and Machine Learning**. My goal was to create **hackathon-ready projects and end-to-end pipelines**, while keeping a clear record of everything I learned.

## Sprint Timeline

| Week | Dates | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Nov 27 – Dec 3 | Linear Algebra + Vector Calculus | Project10X micro-projects, MatrixOps class, visual notebook |
| 2 | Dec 4 – Dec 10 | Probability & Statistics | Simulated distributions project, DS workflow notebook |
| 3 | Dec 11 – Dec 17 | Backend Engineering | Async API endpoints, background jobs, Redis pipelines, WebSocket service |
| 4 | Dec 18 – Dec 23 | Full ML Project | End-to-end ML pipeline: data ingestion → preprocessing → models → API → minimal frontend |

## My Journey

I kicked off the sprint by diving into **Linear Algebra**, because I knew I needed a strong computational foundation for ML. I implemented **matrix operations, vector projections, and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization**, and worked on **Project10X micro-projects** to cement my understanding. I also built my **MatrixOps class**, which gave me a reusable tool for future projects.

With the foundation in place, I moved on to **Probability and Statistics**. I focused on understanding uncertainty and building the statistical backbone for ML workflows. I completed **simulated distributions projects** and created a **data-analysis notebook**, culminating in a mini project that mimicked a real-world data workflow.

Next, I tackled **Backend Engineering**. I built **async API endpoints, background workers using Celery, Redis caches, and WebSocket-based real-time updates**. By the end of the week, I had a fully functional **real-time data pipeline** that could serve as the backbone for ML models.

Finally, I integrated everything in a **Full ML Project**, simulating a hackathon scenario. I ingested data, preprocessed it, trained baseline and improved models, created API endpoints, and even built a minimal React frontend to visualize outputs. By the end of the sprint, I had a **complete, deployable ML micro-product** that combined all the skills I had learned.

## Goals & Reflections

- I wanted to achieve **deep mastery** in math, stats, backend, and ML.  
- I aimed to produce **hackathon-ready pipelines** while keeping everything documented.  
- I kept a **structured record** of my progress, reflections, and project outputs.  
- The sprint allowed me to develop **portfolio-quality projects** that integrate both theory and practice.

## How I Use This Repo

- I follow the weeks sequentially to **retrace my learning journey**.  
- I use the notebooks and projects as **templates or references** for future work.  
- The documentation lets me **review concepts and refresh skills** whenever needed.
